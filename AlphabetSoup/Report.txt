Alphabet Soup Funding Success Analysis

Overview: The goal of this analysis is to implement deeplearning to produce a model to determine the likelihood of success for funding 
	applicants

Results:
	Data Preprocessing:
	- Our target for the model was an binary variable for the success or failure of the funded venture, with 1 being a success and 0 
	being a failure
	- Our features for the model included the name of the applicant, the type of application, the affiliation of the applicant, the 
	classification of the venture, the use case of the funds, the type of organization the applicant falls under, the income amount 
	of the applicant, whether there are any special considerations for the applicant, and how much they are requesting
	- We removed the EIN, as this was an unnecessary identifier.

	Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
	- Our model used two hidden layers with ten nodes each, both using Relu activation, and a one node output layer using sigmoid 
	activation. This set up was used to maximize the accuracy of the model using the fewest layers.
	- Our model achieved an accuracy of 77.14%, exceeding the 75% target.
	- The most significant step to improve the performance of the model was the inclusion of binned applicant name data. 
		+ The Name data was ordered by the number of applications for each name, then all applicants below one hundred were 
		binned as 'Other'.

Summary: Overall the model was able to meet and exceed the target accuracy, however it is possible that it could have been exceeded if 
	more computing power was available. While using Google Colab for the analysis, there where instances where the code maxed out 
	the permitted RAM usage for a free account. This was overcome by binning the data, however it is possible that such binning 
	reduced the accuracy of the model.
